# StockAlerts

Description: With this project, you can now get email alerts about changes in stock prices

Inspiration: A lot of poeple get tensed trying to get the best price possible for a stock to make profits, but are unsuccessful most of the time. With this project however, that will no longer be the case because people can now get alerts to their email regarding the price of a stock of their choice. 

Problem Solved: People can now enjoy their daily lives and not worry about stock prices that much anymore, since they will be getting alerts on their emails when the price of a stock of their chouce changes.

Tools and technologies used: Some of the tools used to build this project on visual studio codes were the yfinance library, and the pandas_datareader library. With the help of these librarys, I was able to fetch stock market data to use for my project. pandas_datareader onm the other hand, allowed me to work with realtime stock prices.

Challenges faced: One of the main challenge faced while building this project was importing the yfinance and pandas_datareader library. Even after installing and importing the libraries, python was unable to detect them. However, after a lot of difficulties, I was finally able to resolve this issue.

What I learned: One of the most important thing I learned while making this project is to always stay calm while making complex programms.
